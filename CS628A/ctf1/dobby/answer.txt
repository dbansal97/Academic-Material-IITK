Command - python -c 'print "123478\n" + (chr(0x7b)+chr(0x86)+chr(0x04)+chr(0x08))*70 + "\ncrucio"' | ./dobby 

In this main function is calling keep_secret function which can be exploited.

In the keep_secret function my input is getting compared to a predefined integer and then jump is taken accordingly. I need to take that jump for further exploitation.

Now I needed to call the get_flag function and hence I give its address in the second input which overwrited the return address and now I'm in the get_flag function. I used Buffer Overflow stack exploit.

In get_flag function my input is getting compared to the string "crucio" so to decide whether to make jump to end of function or go to make a syscall which is showing the flag.txt file.
