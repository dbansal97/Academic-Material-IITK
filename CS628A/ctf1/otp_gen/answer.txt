In this question the main function is taking a input and concatenate the time and input and then print the MD5SUM of the resultant string.

Now the question said that OTP was generated and saved initially, so I guessed that the hash (MD5SUM) time of pass.db and my username dbansal should be the required hash.

I used the online md5sum generator to get it.
