This is similar to VirtualTourist question except the additional argument of name of file.

In this inside main there is a gets() function call which can be exploited. Now main will call _Z5greetP7Greeter function which is dereferancing the value of eax register two times and then calling eax.

So I want the address of getFlag() function in the eax so that it got called and I get the flag stored in a file which is being opened by fopen() which takes filename as a agrument which I provide.

To do so I used gets() of main to write the address of location of stack which will be holding the address of getFlag().

Also I've created the file named nopSlide.py which is used to run the program on various offsets to get flag.
